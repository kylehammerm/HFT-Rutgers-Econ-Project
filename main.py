"""
Main module for running the arbitrage detection system.
Reads an enhanced trade log, applies detection rules, and outputs a CSV of arbitrage probability per agent per tick.

README: 
This arbitrage detection framework is designed to be modular and extensible. It uses rule-based detectors 
that analyze trade logs post-hoc (after the trades have occurred) to identify patterns indicative of arbitrage behavior. 

**Structure:**
- **config.py:** Contains configuration such as which fields are considered observable (and thus allowed for use 
  in detection) and default parameters for the detection rules. You can adjust these settings (e.g., time windows, 
  thresholds) to fine-tune the detectors.
- **rules.py:** Defines the base `DetectionRule` class and specific rule implementations. Initially, we provide:
  - `RoundTripProfitRule`: Flags quick buy-sell round trips with profit (a common arbitrage signature).
  - `PredictiveTradeRule`: Flags trades that are followed by favorable price moves, implying the trader anticipated the move.
  New rules can be added by subclassing `DetectionRule` and implementing the `detect` method.
- **main.py:** Orchestrates the detection process. It reads the trade log, filters fields to ensure only allowed data 
  is used, then applies each rule and combines their outputs into final probabilities per agent per tick. 
  Finally, it writes the results to a CSV file.

**Extensibility:**
- *Adding a new rule:* Create a new class in `rules.py` inheriting `DetectionRule`. Implement its `detect` method 
  to output a suspicion score (0.0 to 1.0) for any agent at any tick where your rule finds arbitrage-like behavior. 
  Specify which fields it uses (to ensure compliance with observable data only). Then include an instance of 
  your rule in the list of rules in `main.py`.
- *Integrating ML or statistical models:* You can wrap a trained machine learning model or statistical detector in 
  a class inheriting `DetectionRule`. For example, `MLModelDetector` could load a model (in its constructor) and in 
  `detect()` iterate over the timeline or use windowed features of the trade log to assign probabilities for each agent 
  at each tick. The system will treat it just like a rule-based detector. Ensure that any features used by the model 
  are derived from allowed fields (or other real-world observable data like public price feeds).
- *Configuring input fields per model:* The `fields` attribute in each `DetectionRule` subclass indicates which trade log 
  fields that rule uses. This makes it clear what data influences each detection method. The framework checks that these 
  fields are a subset of ALLOWED_FIELDS from config. If you want to experiment with a detector that uses a different set 
  of inputs (say, excluding volume or including an observable order book metric), you can adjust the rule's fields and 
  ensure `ALLOWED_FIELDS` in config is updated accordingly (still avoiding any non-public data).
- *Combining multiple detectors:* Currently, the system combines multiple rules by assuming independence and using a 
  probabilistic OR formula: `P_combined = 1 - Î (1 - P_rule_i)` for each agent at each tick across all rules. This means 
  if any rule flags an event strongly, the combined probability will be high (up to 1.0). You can easily modify the 
  combination logic (e.g., to a simple average or weighted sum) in the code where indicated.

**Usage:**
- Prepare the trade log data (as a CSV or in-memory list of trades). Ensure it contains only the allowed fields or that 
  disallowed fields are filtered out.
- Adjust configurations or rules as needed, then run this script. It will produce an output CSV where each row corresponds 
  to a tick in the simulation/market timeline, each column is an agent, and each cell is the probability that the agent 
  was engaging in arbitrage at that tick.
- Rows (ticks) with no activity will have probability 0.0 for all agents (meaning no evidence of arbitrage at those times).
